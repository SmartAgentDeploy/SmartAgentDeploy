# AI Models and Strategies

This document provides detailed information about the AI models and trading strategies implemented in the SmartAgentDeploy platform.

## Overview

SmartAgentDeploy uses various machine learning and deep learning models to analyze market data and generate trading signals. The platform supports multiple strategy types, each with its own strengths and use cases.

## Model Types

### 1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction and sequence modeling.

**Architecture:**
- Input layer: Normalized market data features
- LSTM layers: 1-3 layers with configurable units (default: 50)
- Dropout layers: For regularization (default: 0.2)
- Dense output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification

**Use Cases:**
- Trend prediction
- Price movement direction forecasting
- Pattern recognition in time series data

**Configuration Parameters:**
```json
{
  "units": 50,
  "dropout": 0.2,
  "recurrentDropout": 0.2,
  "optimizer": "adam",
  "loss": "binary_crossentropy",
  "metrics": ["accuracy"],
  "batchSize": 32,
  "epochs": 50,
  "validationSplit": 0.2,
  "sequenceLength": 60,
  "patience": 10
}
```

### 2. DNN (Deep Neural Network)

DNN is a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers for complex pattern recognition.

**Architecture:**
- Input layer: Flattened and normalized market data features
- Hidden layers: 2-4 dense layers with decreasing units
- Dropout layers: For regularization
- Dense output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-factor analysis
- Non-linear pattern recognition
- Feature importance learning

**Configuration Parameters:**
```json
{
  "hiddenLayers": [64, 32, 16],
  "dropout": 0.2,
  "activation": "relu",
  "outputActivation": "sigmoid",
  "optimizer": "adam",
  "loss": "binary_crossentropy",
  "metrics": ["accuracy"],
  "batchSize": 32,
  "epochs": 50,
  "validationSplit": 0.2,
  "patience": 10
}
```

### 3. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training.

**Architecture:**
- Multiple decision trees trained on random subsets of data
- Feature bagging to reduce correlation between trees
- Majority voting for classification decisions

**Use Cases:**
- Robust prediction with limited data
- Feature importance analysis
- Handling non-linear relationships

**Configuration Parameters:**
```json
{
  "nEstimators": 100,
  "maxDepth": 10,
  "minSamplesSplit": 2,
  "minSamplesLeaf": 1,
  "bootstrap": true,
  "nJobs": -1,
  "randomState": 42
}
```

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Trend Following

This strategy aims to capture gains through long-term price movements in a particular direction.

**Implementation:**
- Uses LSTM model to predict price direction
- Enters position when strong trend is detected
- Exits position when trend weakens or reverses
- Incorporates technical indicators like moving averages and MACD

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: Small position sizes, tight stop-loss
- Medium: Moderate position sizes, standard stop-loss
- High: Larger position sizes, wider stop-loss

### 2. Mean Reversion

This strategy is based on the assumption that prices will revert to their historical mean over time.

**Implementation:**
- Uses statistical models to identify overbought/oversold conditions
- Enters counter-trend positions when price deviates significantly from mean
- Exits when price returns to mean or moving average
- Incorporates Bollinger Bands and RSI indicators

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: Small position sizes, exit at first sign of continued trend
- Medium: Moderate position sizes, standard mean reversion parameters
- High: Larger position sizes, wider deviation thresholds

### 3. Breakout Trading

This strategy aims to capture profits from significant price movements that occur when price breaks through support or resistance levels.

**Implementation:**
- Uses DNN model to identify potential breakout patterns
- Enters position when price breaks through key levels with increased volume
- Sets stop-loss below/above the breakout level
- Incorporates volume analysis and volatility indicators

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: Requires stronger confirmation signals, tighter stop-loss
- Medium: Standard breakout parameters
- High: More aggressive entry, wider stop-loss

## Feature Engineering

The platform uses various features derived from raw market data:

### Price Features
- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Volume
- Price change and percentage change
- Trading range

### Technical Indicators
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Bollinger Bands
- Stochastic Oscillator
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Average Directional Index (ADX)

### Time Features
- Hour of day
- Day of week
- Day of month
- Month
- Is weekend flag

## Model Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Historical market data is collected from various sources
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering
3. **Feature Selection**: Important features are selected based on correlation and importance
4. **Train-Test Split**: Data is split into training and validation sets
5. **Model Training**: The selected model is trained on the training data
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Model parameters are optimized using grid search or random search
7. **Validation**: Model is validated on the validation set
8. **Backtesting**: Strategy is backtested on historical data
9. **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, profit/loss, and win rate are calculated

## Performance Metrics

The platform evaluates models using the following metrics:

### Classification Metrics
- Accuracy: Overall prediction accuracy
- Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions
- Recall: Ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Trading Metrics
- Profit/Loss: Absolute and percentage profit or loss
- Win Rate: Percentage of profitable trades
- Maximum Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return
- Sortino Ratio: Downside risk-adjusted return

## Model Deployment

Trained models are deployed in the following ways:

1. **Local Deployment**: Models run on the platform's servers
2. **Blockchain Deployment**: Model parameters and execution logic are deployed to smart contracts
3. **Hybrid Deployment**: Prediction happens off-chain, execution happens on-chain

## Model Updating

Models are regularly updated to maintain performance:

1. **Scheduled Retraining**: Models are retrained on new data at regular intervals
2. **Performance-Based Retraining**: Models are retrained when performance drops below thresholds
3. **Incremental Learning**: Models are updated with new data without full retraining
